# Car Park Simulator

A Java-based parking garage simulation system that models the operations of a multi-floor car park with entry/exit barriers, ticket management, and payment processing.

## Overview

This project simulates a realistic parking garage environment with the following key components:
- Multi-floor parking structure
- Automated entry and exit barriers
- Ticket generation and validation system
- Payment processing with time-based pricing
- Real-time space availability tracking

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-floor Structure**: Configurable number of floors with customizable parking spaces per floor
- **Barrier System**: Automated entrance and exit barriers with ticket validation
- **Ticket Management**: Automatic ticket generation with unique IDs and timestamps
- **Pricing System**: Time-based parking fees calculated per minute
- **Space Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of available parking spaces
- **Payment Processing**: Cash desk system for ticket payment validation

### Current Implementation
- 5 floors with 50 parking spaces each (configurable)
- CHF 1.50 per minute pricing (configurable)
- Entrance barrier with automatic ticket generation
- Two exit barriers with payment verification
- Exception handling for invalid tickets

â”œâ”€â”€ Main.java                    # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ CarParc.java                 # Main parking garage class
â”œâ”€â”€ Barrier.java                 # Entry barrier implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ ExitBarrier.java             # Exit barrier with ticket validation
â”œâ”€â”€ Floor.java                   # Individual floor management
â”œâ”€â”€ ParkingSpot.java             # Individual parking space

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.) or command line tools

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd carParcSimulator
   ```

2. Navigate to the source directory:
   ```bash
   cd app/src/main/java/ch/javamilesiii
   ```

3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac -d . *.java
   ```

4. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   java parkhausSimulator.Main
   ```

## Usage

The simulator provides an interactive console interface with the following options:
1. **Enter the parking garage** - Generate a ticket and pass through the entrance barrier
2. **Pay your ticket** - Process payment for parking duration
3. **Exit the parking garage** - Validate paid ticket and exit through barrier
4. **Exit the simulation** - Terminate the program

### Example Workflow
1. Customer enters parking garage â†’ Ticket generated automatically
2. Customer parks on selected floor
3. Customer returns to pay ticket at cash desk
4. Customer exits through barrier after ticket validation

## Configuration

You can modify the parking garage settings in `Main.java`:

```java
int floors = 5;              // Number of floors
int parkingSpots = 50;       // Spaces per floor
float pricePerMinute = 1.5f; // Price in currency units per minute
```

## Class Relationships

- **CarParc**: Central controller managing all components
- **Floor**: Contains parking spots and cash desk
- **Barrier/ExitBarrier**: Control vehicle access
- **TicketMachine**: Handles ticket lifecycle
- **CashDesk**: Processes payments and calculates fees
- **Ticket**: Stores parking session data

## Current Status

### Implemented Features âœ…
- Basic parking garage structure
- Ticket generation and management
- Barrier operations with timing
- Payment calculation system
- Space availability tracking
- Custom exception handling

### In Development ðŸš§
- Complete user interface implementation
- Floor selection and parking spot assignment
- Display system for real-time updates
- Enhanced error handling

## Contributing

This project is part of an educational exercise. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are welcome!

### Areas for Development
- Complete the `IOHandler` implementation
- Implement the `Display` class functionality
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Improve error handling and validation
- Add logging capabilities
